<h1>cloud compute</h1>
<p>
  State of cloud compute is bad, especially if you're a person like me. I'm a
  tinkerer, I never train models, I don't think I've ever used a gpu to its full
  capacity, other than maybe 1 or 2 times. All I care about is getting an
  interface to a gpu of whatever architecture, throwing sticks at it and seeing
  how it responds. Other users can use that gpu as much as they want for all I
  care, I'm not efficiencymaxxing, I'm simply developing software for this gpu.
  5 copies of oxrinz could work on the same machine without noticing each
  others' existence.

  Unless you have your own computer, for some reason, this is ... hard to do to
  say the least. Most cloud compute providers expect you to use them at max
  capacity, therefore charging an enormous amount for the worth of what I'm
  trying to do. I don't care about calculating costs, I don't care about
  checking up on my balance every hour, I don't care about uptime, reliability,
  most of the time I wouldn't even care about bottlenecked hardware lol

  In an ideal world, I'd pay x a month to access all kinds of gpus on certain
  terms. You can set me a usage limit, I probably won't hit it. The machines
  should feel as though they're mine, fast startup times, the things I need
  should be cached in one way or another, and I should be able to use my nix
  flakes on all of them. I want to be able to do a quick 20 minute coding
  sessions without spending half of the time on setting up an instance.

  I've been trying to get access to a tenstorrent machine for the past ~6 months
  with 0 luck, koyeb doesn't want to open their compute for me, and there is no
  tenstorrent on runpod, or any other cloud compute provider. I literally got
  bullied into buying a card just because no one has it up for rent. I don't
  understand why this is the case, there are so many hpc devs seeking a better
  life, why is there no gpu cloud provider built for this fact. Are you saying
  there is not a single person in the world that's looking to rent a tenstorrent
  machine, purely for development purposes? You have bounties for thousands of
  dollars but no way of fulfilling them without spending more than what you'd
  get from bounties upfront.

  I'm not interested in making a startup but I am interested in solving this
  problem, at the very least for myself. To be precise, I'm looking for cloud
  compute that's 10x cheaper, and has 10x faster startup times. I don't know how
  I'll do it, but I know it's possible. Once I figure out the solution, I'll
  post this blog and give you access to it.
